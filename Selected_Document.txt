A genetic assessment of the English
bulldog
Niels C. Pedersen1*, Ashley S. Pooch2and Hongwei Liu1
Abstract
Background: This study examines genetic diversity among 102 registered English Bulldogs used for breeding based
on maternal and paternal haplotypes, allele frequencies in 33 highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) loci on 25
chromosomes, STR-linked dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class I and II haplotypes, and the number and size of
genome-wide runs of homozygosity (ROH) determined from high density SNP arrays. The objective was to assess
whether the breed retains enough genetic diversity to corre ct the genotypic and phenotypic abnormalities associated
with poor health, to allow for the elimination of deleterious recessive mutations, or to make further phenotypic changes
in body structure or coat. An additional 37 English bulldogs presented to the UC Davis Veterinary Clinical Services for
health problems were also genetically compared with t he 102 registered dogs based on the perception that
sickly English bulldogs are products of commercial breeders or puppy-mills and genetically different and inferior.
Results: Four paternal haplotypes, with one occurring in 93 % of dogs, were identified using six Y-short tandem
repeat (STR) markers. Three major and two minor matrilin es were identified by mitochondrial D-loop sequencing.
Heterozygosity was determined from allele frequencies a t genomic loci; the average number of alleles per locus
was 6.45, with only 2.7 accounting for a majority of the div ersity. However, observed and expected heterozygosity
values were nearly identical, indicating that the population as a whole was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).
However, internal relatedness (IR) and adjusted IR (IRVD) values demonstrated that a number of individuals were
the offspring of parents that were either more inbred or ou tbred than the population as a whole. The diversity of
DLA class I and II haplotypes was low, with only 11 identified DLA class I and nine class II haplotypes. Forty one
percent of the breed shared a single DLA class I and 62 % a single class II haplotype. Nineteen percent of the dogs were
homozygous for the dominant DLA class I haplotype and 42 % for the dominant DLA class II haplotype. The extensive
loss of genetic diversity is most likely the result of a small founder population and artificial genetic bottlenecks occurring
in the past. The prominent phenotypic changes characteristic of the breed have also resulted in numerous large runs of
homozygosity (ROH) throughout the genome compared to Sta ndard Poodles, which were phenotypically more similar
to indigenous-type dogs.
Conclusions: English bulldogs have very low genetic diversity resulting from a small founder population and artificial
genetic bottlenecks. Although some phenotypic and genotypic diversity still exists within the breed, whether it is
sufficient to use reverse selection to improve health, sel ect against simple recessive deleterious traits, and/or to
accommodate further genotypic/phenotypic manipulations without further decreasing existing genetic diversity
is questionable.

Plain English Summary
The English bulldog is one of the most popular breeds
in the world because of its child-like appearance and de-
meanor. The alterations in body type and behavior needed
to create the breed have required physical changes well
beyond its village dog ancestors. These changes have oc-
curred over hundreds of years but have become particu-
larly rapid over the last decades. Unfortunately, popularity
does not equate to health and there have been increasing
pressures on breeders to moderate the extreme physical
changes that now affect the breed and its health. Im-
proving health through genet ic manipulations presumes
that enough diversity still exists to improve the breed
from within, and if not, to add diversity by outcrossing
to other breeds. The present study was an assessment
of genetic diversity that stil l exists in a representative
number of individual English bulldogs using DNA ra-
ther than pedigrees. The results confirm that the breed
has lost considerable genetic diversity through such
things as small founder population and artificial genetic
bottlenecks resulting from highly focused selection for
specific desired physical traits. This is manifested by a
narrowing of allele diversity in many parts of the genome,
and the creation of numerous large regions of the genome
that are essentially identical within the breed, which are
significantly different from other dogs. Loss of genetic di-
versity is also pronounced in the region of the genome
that contains many of the genes that regulate normal im-
mune responses. The loss of genetic diversity and extreme
changes in various regions of the genome will make it very
difficult to improve breed health from within the existing
gene pool. Loss of present genetic diversity is further
threatened by rapid integration of new coat color muta-
tions, increased wrinkling of the coat, and attempts to
create a more compact body type. Contrary to current be-
liefs, brachycephaly and the resulting breathing problems
in the breed are the result of complex changes in head
structure, and cannot be corrected by merely lengthening
the face. Furthermore, other issues in English bulldogs
need to be addressed, including many serious health prob-
lems that are not associated with brachycephaly, but are
intrinsic to inbreeding.
Background
The first mention of what might be a contemporary type
bulldog was reported in 1632 [1]. The “bull ”refers to the
breed ’s use in the sport of bull baiting in England. Bull
baiting, which had its beginning even centuries earlier
with the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, became a na-
tional sport in England from the 13thto 18thcenturies
[1]. The objective was for the dog to latch onto the bull ’s
nose and force it to the ground, with the first dog to do
so the victor. These original bulldogs had stockier bodies,
larger heads and stronger jaws, and a more ferocious andaggressive temperament than the common indigenous
dogs of the period. Therefore, their ancestors were pre-
s u m a b l ym a s t i f f - t y p ed o g so r i g i n a l l yb r e di nA s i af o r
their strength and aggressive ness. Controversy exists as
to whether these Mastiffs were crossed with breeds
such as the Pug to make them more effective at bull
baiting [1]. The first description of a Bulldog as a dis-
tinct entity from the Mastiff was in 1631 in a letter
w r i t t e nf r o mM r .E a t o ni nS p a i nt oaf r i e n di nE n g l a n d
[1]. The bulldog was further genetically altered over the
500 year period of bull baiting by “selection of the fit-
test, ”with emphasis on increasing agility and putting
more power and weight into the head and front end to
minimize spinal damage when they were shaken by the
bulls [1].
Attempts to legislate against bull baiting began in the
UK in 1802 and the sport was finally abolished by an
Act of Parliament in 1835, which led the breed to the
brink of extinction [1]. The Bulldog endured by the efforts
of a small group of aficionados and the breed underwent
even more change in size and temperament after 1835 to
ultimately make them into the shorter-faced, squatter and
more affable companion dog that we know today.1The
first Bulldogs appeared in show rings in the UK in 1860,
and the Bulldog was first recognized by the American
Kennel Club in 1886.2
A number of modern breeds use “bull ”or“bulldog ”in
their names and all have evolved from the original Bull-
dogs and Mastiff-type dogs [1, 2]. Some of these breeds
are of more ancient origin, while others are reconstruc-
tions of breeds that no longer exist. The modern Olde
English Bulldogge is a reconstruction of the original
bulldog based on crosses between English bulldog,
American bulldog, American Pit Bull Terrier and Mastiff.3
The Miniature bulldogs, French bulldog and American
bulldog are also constructed breeds that nonetheless trace
some of their ancestry to the original English bulldog.
Although there are several “bulldogs, ”the ideal English
bulldog is easily differentiated by its huge head with
wedge-shaped body, short and folded ears; stocky build
with deep furrows of the skin, especially of the face;
short or corkscrew tail; short thick legs with equally
broad paws; and a gentle, child-like appearance and dis-
position [2].
The outward appearance of many dog breeds change
with time, and this is also true of the English bulldog.4,5
Photographs of English bulldogs from the nineteenth
century depict dogs with less pronounced brachycephaly,
less chondrodystrophic skeletal structure, a long tail, and
without excessive skin folds on their face or body.6A
picture of an English bulldog from 1935 can be found
on an orange crate label advertising California oranges
(Fig. 1) and this dog was already differing in appearance
from its ancestors pictured a century earlier and fromPedersen et al. Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  (2016) 3:6 Page 2 of 16
contemporary English bulldogs. However, photographs
of modern English bulldogs still demonstrate a range of
phenotypic diversity, with some dogs being smaller and
squatter or larger and longer-legged, some with smooth
rather than wrinkled coats, some with less brachyceph-
alic and furrowed faces, some with longer and less chon-
drodystrophic limbs, some more prognathous than
others, some with intact tails, and others with different
shaped remnants of tails.7,8
Although much has been said about the ill-health of
contemporary English Bulldogs, the English bulldog of
the late 19thcentury also had its share of health prob-
lems and critics.5Therefore, the English bulldog was not
initially popular in the UK, although its popularity has
greatly increased over the last decades in many affluent
countries [3]. English bulldog owners love their baby-
like appearance and demeanor and the breed has been
cited as one of the prime examples of exuberant an-
thropomorphism [4]. Health problems of the breed have
not decreased its popularity and deviations from the ori-
ginal standard based on changing perceptions of “cham-
pion form ”have led to even more conformational
changes that have further affected breed health.5
The health problems of the English bulldog have been
well documented and start with conception, fetal devel-
opment and parturition. Severe conformational changes
have necessitated a high rate of artificial insemination and
Caesarean sections and litter sizes tend to be small.5,9The
breed ranks second in congenital disease and associated
puppy mortality [5], due mainly to birth defects such as
flat chests with splayed legs; anasarca (water babies) and
cleft palate [6].10,11Although some English bulldogs enjoyreasonable health, their longevity is definitely affected by
the degree of conformational change and inbreeding,
which is reflected by lifespan estimates ranging from 3.2
to 11.3 years with a median of 8.4 years [7]. Individuals re-
quiring extensive veterinary care at a young age rarely live
beyond 5 –6 years of age, leading to a bimodal mortality
curve for the breed.11
The brachycephalic syndrome is a leading cause of ill-
health and death in the breed. However, the syndrome is
not caused by brachycephaly per se, as brachycephalic
breeds such as the boxer do not suffer the syndrome to
the same degree. The bulldog tongue is excessively large
at the base, the palate is large and easily obstructed by
the base of the tongue, the lower jaw is pushed forward
(prognathous), and the nares are frequently stenotic and
the trachea hypoplastic. This leads to loud panting during
physical exercise, stridor during rest and slobbering; sleep
apnea, hypercapnia and hypochloremia/hypomagnesemia;
exercise intolerance, cyanosis and collapse; and choking
fits manifested by gagging, retching, vomiting, aerophagia/
flatulence and aspiration pneumonia [8 –12]. The breath-
ing difficulties of English bulldogs also make them very
sensitive to overheating and heat stroke.
Chondrodysplasia, a heritable skeletal disorder that
has been incorporated into the phenotype of many dog
breeds [13], predisposes English bulldogs to skeletal dis-
orders such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, luxating
patella and shoulders, intervertebral disk disease, cruciate
ligament rupture, hemivertebra , torsional pelvic deformity
and problems with normal copulation and parturition [14,
15]. Prognathism predisposes to dental disease, while exces-
sive folding of the skin, especially on the face, is associated
with skin fold dermatitis, muzzle acne, folliculitis, furuncu-
losis, and eye conditions such as entropion, ectropion, and
eversion of the third eyelid. The cork-screw tail can result
in tail fold dermatitis. Other heritable conditions that are
related to loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding include
cataract, various heart valve defects including pulmonic
stenosis, hydrocepha lus, cysteine urolithiasis, and hiatal
hernias; immunologic disorders that include a propensity
for severe demodectic mange indicative of immunodefi-
ciency, allergies associated with atopic dermatitis and ear
infections, and autoimmune diseases such as
hypothyroidism; and cancers in cluding glioblastoma, mast
cell sarcoma and lymphoma [15, 16]. Although the bond
and affection between English b ulldogs and their owners is
strong, the cost of treating heal th problems is often prohibi-
tive and many of them end up in shelters or euthanized.
Severe health problems in English bulldogs in the USA
and the UK have prompted articles [16] such as “Can
the Bulldog be saved? ”The article documented the short
lives of University of Georgia mascots and re-kindled
the humane issues of knowingly breeding dogs destined
to lives of serious ill-health. An earlier broadcast on the

BBC spawned three independent reports identifying the
English bulldog as a breed in need of genetic interven-
tion, presumably to breed away from the extremes of
brachycephaly and chondrodysplasia and increase gen-
etic diversity. The British Kennel Club responded to
these criticisms by revising the English bulldog standard
to select against obvious breathing difficulties and avoid
extreme facial wrinkling.12However, bulldog breeders in
the UK argue that “what you ’ll get is a completely different
dog, not a British bulldog ”12, a strange argument given the
continuous phenotypic ch anges that have occurred
within the breed over many decades.6,7,8Groups in The
Netherlands have called for a ban on English bulldogs
based on a belief that the breed can no longer be
returned to a health, while supporters believe that the
breed can be returned to health from within and are peti-
tioning the government against the ban.13American
breeders of English bulldogs have avoided the issue and
even deny that the breed is unhealthy, pointing to its
popularity as proof [3]. However, the bulldog has been
banned from plane travel in the cargo hold by many do-
mestic and international airlines due to a high incidence
of deaths.14
English bulldogs have risen from 5thto 4thin popularity
between 2013 and 2015 in AKC registrations [3], proving
that the public is more enamored with the dog than con-
cerned about its health. Assuming that this attitude will
change and steps taken to improve the breed ’s health,
how can this best be accomplished? Diehard breeders
would argue that this should involve genetic change
from within existing bloodlines. The question then be-
comes whether there is enough residual phenotypic and
genotypic diversity to significantly improve the health of
the breed using the existing stock. Although there is still
phenotypic variability in the breed based on photo-
graphs6,7,8, bulldogs that reproduce without assistance,
move freely, walk or run for long distances, and breathe
normally even at rest are the exception.
Efforts are underway in the UK to improve the health
of bulldogs from within the breed by making modest
changes on what is acceptable in a show dog. However,
there is very little knowledge about the actual genetic
status of the breed and whether enough genetic and
phenotypic diversity still exists to significantly improve
health without further reducing existing genetic diversity
or relying on outcrossing. Breeders still rely heavily on
pedigrees and coefficients of inbreeding (COI). The
problem is that pedigrees emphasize ancestors and in-
heritance by descent but not actual genetic makeup.
They are also subject to parentage errors and COIs based
on a few recent generations are of limited value in a breed
that started with few founders subjected to numerous arti-
ficial bottlenecks that occurred decades and even centur-
ies earlier. Therefore, we endeavored to conduct a broad-based genetic assessment of the breed using DNA rather
than pedigrees. The findings of this study indicate that
English bulldogs may have insufficient genetic diversity to
significantly improve gross physical abnormalities associ-
ated with poor health, to eliminate simple recessive dele-
terious traits, or to use inbreeding to rapidly integrate new
coat colors and to breed for a smaller and more compact
shape without further decreasing genetic diversity in indi-
viduals and adding to their health problems.
Methods
Sample acquisition and DNA extraction
The Veterinary Genetics Laboratory (VGL) (UC Davis
School of Veterinary Medicine, Davis, CA, USA) provided
DNA samples of 102 registered English Bulldogs; 87 of the
dogs were from the USA, six from Finland, three each from
Canada and Austria, and one each from Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, and Argentina. DNA from these dogs was sub-
mitted mainly for coat color or hyperuricosuria mutation
testing and used in breeding programs. As such, they were
presumed to be of adequate health and therefore listed as
“controls ”. Thirty-seven DNA samples were collected from
whole blood of English bulldogs submitted for various diag-
nostic tests at the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching
Hospital (VMTH). These dogs were seen for a variety of
health problems ranging from breathing problems, eye
problems, skin disorders, orthopedic problems, or cancer
and were therefore listed as “case ”. DNA was extracted
using established procedures [17].
Determination of maternal and paternal haplotypes
Maternal haplotypes were determined by sequencing
655 bp of the mitochondrial D-loop (nucleotide 15453 –
16107) in 48 English Bulldogs as described [18]. Dogs
were as unrelated as possible based on genomic STR
markers. Sequences were analyzed using Geneious soft-
ware [19]. Final sequences were compared to the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
using nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) [20]. Paternal haplotypes were determined
from the 44 male dogs in the group based upon a panel
of six Y-STR markers, including 650.79.2 ,990.35.4 ,MS34A ,
MS34B ,MS41A ,a n d MS41B [21, 22].
Genomic STR markers and DLA class I and II STR markers
Thirty-three STR loci across 25 chromosomes were used
to assess genomic diversity, while four STR loci were
used to determine DLA class I haplotypes and three
STR loci were used for DLA class II haplotypes. The
primer sequences, dye markers, conditions for amplifi-
cation and analysis of these STR markers have been
published [23].Pedersen et al. Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  (2016) 3:6 Page 4 of 16
The use of allele frequencies for standard genetic
assessments
A genetic assessment using allele frequencies was con-
ducted using GenAlEx 6.5 software [24]. The population
statistics used in this study included Aa, Ae, Ho, He, and
the inbreeding coefficient F. Aa represented the average
number of alleles at each locus; Ae represented the aver-
age effective number of alleles at each locus; Ho is ob-
served heterozygosity, while He is the expected
heterozygosity if the population was randomly breeding.
The value F is an inbreeding coefficient derived by [1-
(Ho/He)]. An F value of 0 indicates that the population
as a whole is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE),
i.e., randomly breeding. A negative F value of −1.0 indicates
that that every member of the population is genetically
distinct, while a F value of +1.0 indicates that all members
were genetically identical. Pri ncipal coordinate analysis
(PCoA) was performed in Excel using the XLSTAT
software.
Internal relatedness (IR) is a statistical estimate of how
closely an individual dog ’s parents were related to each
other [23]. It also uses allele frequency data, but unlike
Ho and He, it gives more weight to uncommon alleles.
An IR value of −1.0 means both parents were totally un-
related, while a value of +1.0 means the parents were
genetically identical. Internal relatedness values can also
be used to plot the population as a whole and estimate
the amount of genetic diversity lost as a result of breed
creation [23]. The latter estimate is made by adjusting
the frequencies of alleles found at each genomic STR
locus to the frequency of the same allele in a large popu-
lation of random breeding village dogs, thus yielding IR-
village dog (IRVD). These village dogs breed randomly
and have genetic links with most modern breeds, and
they are one of the largest single reservoirs of ancestral
diversity inherited by descent [22, 25, 26]. The IR and
IRVD were graphed using the software R [27].
Analysis of GWAS data for runs of homozygosity
Illumina 170 K CanineHD datasets for English bulldog
and Standard poodle were obtained from other GWAS
studies [28, 29] and filtered for minor allele frequency
(<0.05) and genotype (>90 %). Ten English bulldogs and
10 Standard Poodles were randomly selected and their
SNP arrays interrogated for runs of homozygosity (ROH)
using PLINK [30]. Runs of homozygosity with allele shar-
ing across all individuals were identified by applying the
option –homozyg-group . The analysis yielded the number,
size range of ROH, and the portion of ROH that was
shared (consensus ROH) by all individuals interrogated.
This information was extended by looking for the con-
sensus ROH that were shared by 6 –9o ft h e1 0i n d i -
viduals tested.Results
Paternal haplotypes
Paternal haplotypes were determined for 44 male English
Bulldogs in the study population using six Y-specific
STRS. Haplotype 1 was dominant in 93.1 % of the dogs,
while haplotype 2 –4 were observed in 2.3 % of dogs each
(Table 1). Paternal haplotypes three and four were closely
related to the dominant haplotype 1 and appeared to arise
from a single mutation in the MS41B STR locus, changing
K to J or L, respectively. Test data from the UC Davis Vet-
erinary Genetics Laboratory has also found the dominant
haplotype 1 of the English bulldog in the French bulldog,
Bull Terrier, Bull mastiff, Miniature bull terrier, Stafford-
shire bull terrier, Wire-haired fox terrier, Beagle, and Coton
de Tulear.
Maternal haplotypes
Five maternal haplotypes were identified in the con-
trol population based on mitochondrial sequences.
The sequences of the haplotypes observed in English
bulldogs corresponded to GenBank Accession num-
bers as follows: EBU-A (GenBank:KP665923), EBU-C
(GenBank:KP665928), EBU-J (GenBank:KP665924), EBU-K
(GenBank:KP665914), and EBU-7 (GenBank:KP665930).
Maternal haplotype frequencies and variations of base pair
positions are listed in Table 2. Three of the five haplotypes
w e r ef o u n di n9 0 . 9%o ft h ed o g s .T h ef i v em a t e r n a lh a p l o -
types identified in English bu lldogs have been found among
a number of common dog breeds, with the three most
common matrilines (EBU-C, −Ja n d –K) also found in
mastiff- and brachycephalic-type breeds (Table 3).
Genetic assessment of healthy and unhealthy English
bulldogs using 33 genomic STR loci
A genetic assessment of 102 control English bulldogs
based on the alleles and their frequencies at each of the
33 genomic STR loci was conducted and the population
statistics were evaluated with GenAlex 6.51 software (Ta-
bles 4 and 5). The highest number of individual alleles
found for a single autosomal STR locus was eleven
(VGL1165 ), and the lowest was three ( INRA21 ). Most of
the loci had one or two alleles that dominated in fre-
quency. Nineteen of 33 loci had single alleles with a fre-
quency ≥50 %, which are highlighted in Table 4. Six of the
STRs had one allele with a frequency of 70 % or greater,
and allele 202 at locus REN162C04 was virtually fixed

with a frequency of 0.99 am ongst the 102 dogs studied
(Table 4). The average number of alleles per locus was
6.46, of which an average of 2.77 alleles per locus con-
tributed disproportionately to overall diversity (Table 5).
The observed and expected heterozygosity (Ho and He)
were essentially the same, yielding an inbreeding coeffi-
cient (F) close to zero. The Ho, He and F values indi-
cated that this population of 102 dogs was in HWE.
Results from a genetic assessment of 37 unhealthy case
dogs were compared to that of the 102 presumably
healthy controls (Table 5). The two populations were es-
sentially identical by all of the genetic parameters, with
the exception of the average alleles per locus for case
dogs, which was a lower in case dogs (Table 5). However,
this difference was due to variation in sample size, be-
cause Aa was similar (5.182 vs 5.364) when the 37 case
dogs were compared to 37 control dogs randomly se-
lected from the larger population by Excel (data not
shown). Observed and expected heterozygosity did not
differ between case and control dogs and the values for
F were near zero for both groups. No differences were
detected between case and control populations by prin-
cipal coordinate analysis (Fig. 2).
Internal relatedness and adjusted internal relatedness
The mean IR value for the 102 English Bulldogs was
0.007, with individuals ranging from −0.234 (most outbred)
to +0.304 (most inbred) (Fig. 3, Table 6). This suggestedthat there were highly inbred individuals in the popula-
tion, which were balanced by an equal portion of outbred
dogs, giving the impression that the population as a whole
was a product of random breeding.
The adjusted IR value (IR-village dog or IRVD) for the
population gave a more accurate measure of just how in-
bred the parents of modern English bulldogs were com-
pared to village- or landrace- type dogs from which the
breed evolved. IRVD values ranged from 0.043 to 0.64
with a mean of 0.335 (Fig. 3, Table 6]. Therefore, 78/102
bulldogs (77 %) had IRVD values >0.25 and were more
closely related to each other than offspring of full sibling
parents from a random breeding village dog population.
Values >0.25 would occur only if full sibling parents
were offspring of inbred parents; the more inbred the
parents the higher the IRVD score.
The IR and IRVD values for English bulldogs were fur-
ther compared with the Standard Poodle (Fig. 4, Table 6).
Standard Poodles like the English bulldog, are very
popular and a sub-population has been extensively inbred
for a uniform and desirable appearance [23]. A compari-
son of minimum and maximum IR values for the two
breeds show parents of individual Standard Poodles to be
both more unrelated ( −0.306 vs −0.234) and related (0.304
vs 0.528) than parents of individual English bulldogs
(Table 6). The differences are even more apparent when
comparing IRVD values (Table 6). This comparison
demonstrated that many Standard Poodles were offspringTable 2 Frequencies and base pair position variations of maternal haplotypes found in English bulldogs

most inbred English bulldogs. Although both breeds ap-
pear to be highly inbred, Standard Poodles have retained
much more genetic diversity across the breed [23].
Frequency of STR-associated DLA Class I and II haplotypes
Eleven DLA class I and nine class II haplotypes were iden-
tified among the 102 English bulldogs tested (Table 7).
The dominant class I haplotype was observed in 40.7 % of
the dogs, while the three most common haplotypes to-
gether accounted for nearly 80 % of all class I haplotypes.
The dominant class II haplotype was found in 62.3 % ofEnglish bulldogs, while the two most common were present
in 86 % of individuals. The three most common DLA class
I and two most common class II haplotypes were homozy-
gous in 24.5 and 50 % of dogs, respectively (Table 7).
Individual alleles within the 7 STR loci that defined the
DLA class I and II regions were assessed for heterozygosity.
Each of seven loci was defined by one dominant and one
semi-dominant allele and several minor alleles (Table 8).
The most common alleles were usually found in the most
prevalent DLA class I and II haplotypes.
Although the DLA is in strong linkage disequilibrium
compared to other regions of the genome, there areTable 4 Allele frequencies at 33 genomic STR loci for 102 control English bulldogs

in the frequency and homozygosity of certain founding
DLA class I and II haplotypes, although the observed
and expected heterozygosity were similar and F was
near zero. The neutral F valu e indicated that the imbal-
ance in DLA classes I/II haplotypes was not a recent
occurrence but resulted from small number of ancestral
founders or artificial genetic bottlenecks much earlier
in breed evolution. Periods of inbreeding associated with
genetic bottlenecks such as popular sire effects are often
followed by a return to random breeding, although the out-
come may be a permanent reduction in founder size [23].
Runs of homozygosity (ROH) in genomes of English
bulldogs and Standard Poodles
The English bulldog is very different in outward appear-
ance to breeds such as the Standard Poodle, which still
resembles its Middle Eastern/SE Asian village dog and
their European Landrace relatives in most aspects.Therefore, variations within genomes of the English bull-
dogs were compared with those of the Standard Poodle.
The implication was that variations within the genome
would be much greater in the English bulldog because the
extreme conformational changes would require much
more intense positive selection within specific parts of the
genome. GWAS data from 10 randomly selected English
bulldogs and Standard Poodles was obtained from previous
studies [23, 29]. The level of inbreeding based on the pro-
portion of SNPs that were homozygous in canine 170 K ar-
rays was virtually identical in the two breeds; 0.65 ± 0.03 in
English bulldogs and 0.63 ± 0.03 in Standard Poodles. The
results of IR and IRVD comparisons also showed that
highly inbred individuals exi sted in both breeds. Therefore,
it can be assumed that variations in the genomes of English
bulldogs and Standard Poodles were not associated with in-
breeding per se, but to strong positive selection pressures
in various regions of the genome related to comparative
breed specific traits and to an associated loss of genetic
diversity. The GWAS data was then used to estimate the
n u m b e ra n ds i z eo fR O Hi nt h et w ob r e e d s .
The largest consensus ROH was determined for all 10
dogs of each breed (Table 10). As expected, the number
of large consensus ROH shared by 100 % of the popula-
tion is low because different proportions of individuals
will possess one or more heterozygous SNP that create
variable sized runs of overlapping homozygosity within
these larger ROH. The effect of this small amount of
heterozygosity can be offset by identifying the largest
consensus ROH shared by at least 9, 8, 7 or 6 out of 10
individuals in the population (Table 10).
Two consensus ROH 4.71 Mb and 2.65 Mb in size
were identified on different chromosomes in 100 % of
English bulldogs tested. The largest autosomal ROH in a
single English bulldog was 58.24 Mb on CFA20. The lar-
gest consensus ROH on the X-chromosome (CFA39)Table 5 Average (Aa) and effective (Ae) alleles per locus of 33

was 51.35 Mb on five of the six male dogs in the group.
The number of consensus ROH that were detected on
autosomes increased as the number of dogs that shared
larger consensus ROH decreased. Nine of ten of the
dogs shared eight additional ROH compared to 10/10
dogs; 8/10 dogs an additional 16 ROH compared to 10/
10 and 9/10 dogs; 7/10 dogs had 39 more ROH com-
pared to 8/10, 9/10 and 10/10 dogs; and 6/10 dogs had
53 more ROH than 7/10, 8/10, 9/10 and 10/10 dogs
(Table 10). In total, 118 consensus ROH ranging from
1.31 to 3.68 Mb on 31 different autosomes were shared
by at least 6 of the 10 dogs studied (Table 10).
The number and size of ROH were much lower in
Standard Poodles than English bulldogs (Table 10). No
consensus ROH was shared among all 10 of the Standard
Poodles and only one ROH of 0.11 Mb was shared by 9/10
of individuals. Twenty-one ROH on 16 chromosomes with
consensus sizes of 1.33 ± 0.83 M were shared by at least 6/
10 of the dogs. The largest ROH of a single Standard
Poodle was 59.16 Mb on CFA11. The largest consensus
ROH was 3.66 Mb on CFA30 shared by 8/10 Standard
Poodles. A total of 30 consensus ROH on 19 chromo-
somes and 0.11 –1.96 MB in size were shared by at least
6/10 Standard Poodles in the population tested. Therefore,
ROH of English bulldogs were larger, more variable in sizebetween individuals, more numerous, and involved many
more chromosomes than those of Standard Poodles.
Discussion
This study examined genetic diversity among contem-
porary English bulldogs used for breeding purposes from
the USA ( n= 87) and several other countries ( n= 15).
Thirty-seven pet English bulldogs seen for health prob-
lems at UC Davis Veterinary Clinical Services were also
included in the study. The populations that were tested
evolved from one major and three minor paternal haplo-
types and three major and two minor maternal haplo-
types. One paternal haplotype, which was found only in
a one dog, appeared to be distinct. The two remaining
minor paternal haplotypes, also in single dogs, differed
from the dominant paternal haplotype by a simple muta-
tion. This pattern of a single dominant paternal haplo-
type and a small number of maternal haplotypes has
been observed in most pure breeds and is therefore not
unique to English bulldogs [21, 25].
The paternal and maternal haplotypes identified in
these English bulldogs provides a window into the
breed ’s ancestry. The dominant paternal haplotype oc-
curs as expected in several bracycephalic breeds that in-
clude “bull ”in their breed names, as well as breeds such
as the Beagle, Coton de Tulear, and Wire-haired fox ter-
rier. The minor unrelated haplotype has been found in a
related genetic form in Akita and Beagles. The two
minor mutant haplotypes have not been seen in any
other breed suggesting that these have arisen by muta-
tions within the breed. The major maternal haplotype
EBU-J occurs in several of the brachycephalic breeds
(Boxer, Pug, Boston Terrier) as well as small Mastiff-
type dogs (Bull Mastiff, English Bull Terrier, American
Pit Bull Terrier), while EBU-K has been found in Asian
Mastiffs such as the Shiba Inu and Shikoku. Therefore,

the maternal haplotypes seen in English bulldogs sup-
port the general belief that English bulldogs evolved
from Mastiff-type dogs crossed with brachycephalic
breeds such as the Pug [1]. It is tempting to associate
paternal rather than maternal introgressions from
smaller and much less aggressive non-brachycephalic
breeds were used to make English bulldogs more accept-
able as household pets.
Evidence obtained from the 33 genomic STR loci pro-
vides additional evidence for the small founder populationand artificial genetic bottlenecks that led to the modern
English bulldog. The average number of alleles per locus
was similar to other pure breeds that have been diversity
tested.15However, an examination of the average effective
alleles per locus indicates that only one or two alleles are
actually contributing to the overall genotype and pheno-
type diversity of the breed. Six of 33 loci had an allele with
frequency >70 %, and allele 202 at locus REN162C04 was
homozygous in 101/102 dogs studied. Loss of genetic di-
versity as a result of pure-breeding, especially when those
breeds undergo selection for conformation, is well docu-
mented [25]. The various conformational changes used in
creating breed-specific phenotypes often results in large
regions of extended homozygosity across the genome
[31 –35]. The larger and more numerous these regions,
the more often they will be associated with an STR and
the more likely that certain STR alleles will be at higher
frequency and also exist in a homozygous state.
Measurements of observed and expected heterozygosity
(Ho and He) and the inbreeding coefficient F are also use-
ful in looking at the genetic makeup of a population. Ob-
served and expected heterozygosity were similar for the
English bulldogs tested, yi elding an inbreeding coeffi-
cient F that was close to zero (0.001). This indicated
that the population as a whole was in HWE despite a
limited gene pool and that English bulldog breeders
were doing a reasonable job of identifying moreTable 7 DLA class I and II haplotypes of 102 English bulldogs and their frequencies. The percentage homozygosity for each

distantly related dogs for mating. However, IR values
indicated that He, Ho and F values were misleading, as
many individual dogs in the study were actually prod-
ucts of parents that were much more related to each
other than assumed from the population-wide fixation
indices.
Internal relatedness has been widely used as an indica-
tor of population fitness [36 –42], implying that closely
related parents reflect a loss of genetic diversity in the
total population under study. The average IR value is
0.25 for a litter of puppies born to full sibling parents
from a genetically diverse and randomly bred popula-
tion. The average IR value for English bulldogs was
around 0.007, however there were a number of individ-
uals with IR values around 0.20. However, IR does not
take into account the degree of genetic diversity that has
been lost as a result of breed development. Virtually all
of modern pure-breeds can trace their origins to village-
type dogs that proliferated during the Neolithic era in
the Middle East and SE Asia and populated other re-
gions of the world [22, 26]. Allele and allele frequencies
found in pure breeds can be adjusted to the frequencies
of those same alleles found in village dog populations
and used to re-calculate or adjust IR values to approxi-
mate the expected diversity if no founder effects or arti-
ficial bottlenecks occurred during a breed ’s evolution.
When IR values were adjusted using allele frequencies in
village dogs, the mean IRVD value for English bulldogs
rose to 0.34, with 50 % of dogs having even greater
values. A mean value of 0.34 indicates that the average
English bulldog is genetically equivalent to offspring of
full sibling parents that came from a highly inbred sub-
population of village-type progenitors. This shift to the
right of the IRVD compared to IR curve was also seen in
Standard Poodles, but to a much less degree, reflecting
the greater amount of initial or retained genetic diversity
in Standard Poodles.
The low number of different DLA class I and II haplo-
types in English bulldogs was associated with an imbal-
ance in the relative frequency of each haplotype. Four of
11 class I and 3/9 class II haplotypes were found in over90 % of the individual English bulldogs tested. Moreover,
there was a high level of homozygosity among the dom-
inant DLA class I (19 %) and II (42 %) haplotypes. Al-
though not balanced in frequency, genetic assessment of
the seven STR alleles associated with the DLA class I
and II regions showed them to be randomly segregating
at this time. This indicated that the over-representation
of certain haplotypes occurred at the onset of breed cre-
ation as a result of small founder numbers, and/or that
it was associated with artificial genetic bottlenecks that
were subsequently masked by a return to random selec-
tion. Although the DLA region is only a small part of
the genome, the importance of these haplotype imbal-
ances, small haplotype numbers, and increased homozy-
gosity should not be underestimated [23, 42]. The breed
suffers greatly from allergies, immunodeficiency, and a
number of autoimmune disorders, which may be a re-
flection of loss of balanced selection and heterozygote
advantage in the DLA region.
In order to gauge the extent to which humans shaped
the phenotype of English bulldogs from typical dogs, we
decided to compare the English bulldog with a breed
that was similarly inbred based on the number of homo-
zygous SNPs identified by Illumina 170 K canine SNP
arrays and IR scores, but outwardly similar in appear-
ance to the ancestral dog. The Standard Poodle, which
has been similarly studied [23], met the desired criteria.
One hundred nineteen ROH with consensus sizes ran-
ging from 1.31 to 3.68 Mb and shared by at least 6/10
dogs tested were identified on 30 of the 38 autosomes.
This was compared to 31 ROH with consensus sizes
ranging from 0.11 to 1.96 MB on 19 chromosomes for
the Standard Poodle. Although a proportion of the ROH
observed in both English bulldog and Standard Poodle
can be attributed to natural selection pressures occur-
ring over thousands of years [33, 34], the differences in
ROH size and number are better explained by the com-

required strong positive selection (strong sweeps) in
specific regions of the genome [43], while ROH re-
quired for the Standard Poodle phenotype were not
nearly as strong or widespread. The variation in ROH
observed in the genome of English bulldogs and Stand-
ard Poodles were in line with the findings of others.
Vaysse and colleagues [32] identified 44 genomic re-
gions among 49 pure breeds that had undergone in-
tense selection and 22 blocks of SNPs in certain breeds
that extended over one million bases. Lindblad-Toh
and a large group of investigators [31] compared the
haplotype structure of the genome of the Boxer and 10
other breeds and found regions of linkage disequilib-
rium extending over several megabases within a breed
and tens of kilobases between breeds.
We did not associate runs of homozygosity in English
bulldogs with characteristic phenotypic traits but are
confident based on previous studies that the greater gen-
omic variation in English bulldogs compared to Standard
Poodles reflected stronger human-directed selection in
the former breed than in the latter. Pollinger and col-
leagues [44] also concluded that strong artificial selection
for breed-defining traits have reduced variation within
many regions of the genome. Associations between ROH
and species/breed traits such as those found in English
bulldogs have been demonstrated for human-directed se-
lection in many pure breeds [29, 32, 33, 45, 46]. Brachy-
cephaly is a prominent phenotypic trait in the English
bulldog and not a naturally selected phenotype of ances-
tral village- or landrace-type dogs. A ROH around 500 kb
on CFA1 was associated with brachycephaly in a study
that compared a number of brachycephalic breeds [29].
A more recent study confirmed the existence of the
brachycephaly-associated region on CFA1 in boxers,
but also identified a >8 Mb ROH on CFA26 [44]. Vari-
ation in CFA10 has been linked to ear morphology and
body mass in a number of breeds [45]. Genomic re-
gions of positive selection in dog breeds have also been
associated with adaption to a diet richer in starch [35].
Vaysse and colleagues [32] also identified runs of
homozygosity associated with breed-defining character-
istics such as chondrodyspl asia in Dachshund [590 Kb]
and wrinkled skin in Sharpei [1.4 Mb], characteristics
of English bulldogs but not Standard Poodles. They also
concluded that artificial selection in domestic animals
targeted different functional categories than natural se-
lection. Pollinger et al., [44] identified a 40 Mb selective
sweep on CFA11 associated with black coat color in
Large Munsterlander and a 10 MB region on CFA3 in
Dachshund containing FGFR3 , which is responsible for
achondroplasia in humans and presumably linked with
related genes responsible for canine chondrodysplasia.It can be assumed from this and other studies that the
small founder population of the English bulldog, estimated
at 68 individuals,16coupled with human created artificial
genetic bottlenecks have greatly diminished genetic diver-
sity and fostered a wide range of health problems. Small
founder numbers and artificial bottlenecks are a much
more powerful cause of lost genetic diversity than in-
breeding [33]. Some bulldog breeders from the UK have
already realized that the artificial selection process had
gone too far, either on their own or bowed by public pres-
sure, and have revised breed standards that discourage
physical features “that might prevent a dog breathing,
walking and seeing freely ”[46]. However, the brachyceph-
alic syndrome in English bulldogs is much more complex
than a “shortened head. ”Breeds such as the Boxer are
similarly brachycephalic but do not suffer to the same de-
gree. In the case of the English bulldog, the nostrils are
narrow, the base of the tongue is large and broad, the pal-
ate elongated and thickened, thus allowing for blockage of
the pharynx especially during sleep [8 –11]. The tracheas
are usually hypoplastic (narrow), further compromising
normal ventilation [47]. The constant pressures on the
upper airways created by these obstructions may also
damage and weaken the laryngeal muscles, cause eversion
of the lateral ventricles, and further decrease pharyngeal
patency [48]. The laryngeal collapse is in turn associated
with bronchial collapse [49]. Therefore, the breathing
problems in the English bulldogs go beyond mere shorten-
ing of the face and require specific changes in the nares,
rostral skull, tongue, oropharynx and trachea. Concentrat-
ing on the brachycephalic syndrome also ignores other
serious problems in the breed, such as inability to breed
and deliver normally, poor mothering, high puppy mortal-
ity, the accumulation of simple recessive deleterious
traits, a number of orthopedic problems, certain cancers,
allergies, immunodeficiency, and autoimmune disorders.
The authors would agree with O ’Neill and colleagues
[50] that breeding reforms should target commonly-
diagnosed complex disorders that are amenable to gen-
etic improvement and should place special focus on at-
risk breeds. Unfortunately, in the case of English bull-
dogs, this list is very long, but it may still be possible to
target the most serious of these disorders for genetic
correction.
Assuming that there is a will to improve the overall
health of English bulldogs, the question raised by this
study is whether or not there is sufficient genotypic di-
versity remaining in the breed to allow “reverse genetics ”
to correct phenotypic abnormalities that have major im-
pacts on health. There are certainly phenotypic differ-
ences that still exist between various lines of English
bulldogs and among individuals, and many English bull-
dogs enjoy much better health than others. The regions
flanking consensus ROH vary greatly in size in individualPedersen et al. Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  (2016) 3:6 Page 12 of 16
English bulldogs, suggesting that some of these regions
may contain “hidden ”genetic diversity that may prove
critical for reversing the degree of brachycephaly or
chondrodysplasia. The existence of phenotypic variation
within the breed is evident from photographs of modern
English bulldogs.7,8The one region of the genome of
English bulldogs that is least amenable to reverse genet-
ics may be the DLA, which has very low diversity based
on DLA class I and II haplotypes and a high level of
homozygosity. The nine DLA class II haplotypes recog-
nized in this group of English bull dogs were only a frac-
tion of the 88 haplotypes that were reported for dogs in
2007 [51]. Genes within the DLA are important in regu-
lating self/non-self recognition and immune responses
and play a role in autoimmune disorders, allergies, and
immun.
Populations that have lost genetic diversity through
small founder numbers and artificial genetic bottlenecks
are more likely to accumulate deleterious traits [33, 52].
A lack of genetic diversity also makes it harder to elim-
inate deleterious traits from a population once they are
recognized. The mutation responsible for hyperuricos-
uria is carried by 25.5 % of English bulldogs and 3.1 % of
the breed are homozygous and excrete uric acid [53].
Elimination of this recessive mutation from the breed
could lead to a significant loss of breed-wide genetic
diversity.
A low level of breed-wide genetic diversity also limits
the ability to rapidly introduce desired traits, usually in
the form of simple recessive mutations. There is in-
creased demand for smaller and more compact English
bulldogs, dogs with wrinkled coats and rare coat colors.
Such refinements in the breed create popular sire effects
and yet more artificial genetic bottlenecks that will cause
the loss of more genetic diversity if not properly man-
aged. The negative effects of the rapid introduction of
new genetic traits on the health have been best docu-
mented in the “The Rare Color Bulldog Craze ”.17Indeed,
English bulldog breeders appear to be more interested in
adding recessive coat color mutations to increase puppy
value than eliminating known deleterious mutations.
English bulldog breeders around the world ordered 2482
tests from VGL UC Davis involving coat color between
2012 and 2016 compared to 62 tests for the hyperuricos-
uria mutation.18
In conclusion, English bulldog breeders differ widely
on their perception of health problems in their breed
and what do about them. Some breeders blame disreput-
able or backyard “commercial ”breeders for the un-
healthy dogs that are being sold.19,20However, genetic
differences were not observed between pet English bull-
dogs seen at the UC Davis Veterinary Clinical Services
and presumably healthy breeding dogs being genetically
tested for certain traits. Healthy and unhealthy bulldogsshared the same alleles at genomic STR loci and the al-
lele frequencies are virtually identical. The same was
true for DLA class I and II haplotypes. Other English
bulldog breeders believe that the health of the breed can
be improved by breeding from within existing blood-
lines, although there has been little movement by
breeders to embrace this concept. This is fueled by pur-
ists that vigorously argue that any deviation from the
original standards is no longer a British (English) bulldog
[47], even though the breed has continued to evolve in
appearance over centuries and even the last few decades.
Still others believe that health cannot be restored from
within the breed without resorting to outcrossing.12,13
The feelings of individual English bulldog breeders
about the health of their breed and what if anything
should be done about it may ultimately be taken out of
their hands. English bulldog breeders across the world
must take seriously constitutional amendments on the
rights of animals. The European Union has recently up-
dated their rules on animal welfare in 2015.21Although
it was written specifically for farm animals; it holds that
“animals ”have rights of ‘freedom from discomfort ”and
‘freedom from pain, injury and disease. ”The EU rules
on animal welfare have been restated in much greater de-
tail by a 2013 constitutional amendment in Switzerland,
which extended such rights to all animals [54]. Although
it has not been uniformly enforced, many Swiss breeders
have proactively begun outcrossing English bulldogs with
the Olde English Bulldogge to create what is known as the
“Continental Bulldog ”,22which will help bring the breed
into compliance.
Conclusions
Breeding of the English bulldog for extremes of brachy-
cephaly, chondrodysplasia, skin folding and child-like
appearance and personality has required a level of human-
directed positive selection that has made the English bull-
dog both one of the most popular and unhealthiest of dog
breeds. A DNA-based assessment of the breed along a
number of parameters has confirmed that the breed is
greatly lacking in genetic diversity, which may preclude or
minimize the ability of breeders to recreate healthier phe-
notypes from existing genetic stock, to eliminate dele-
terious mutations, and to add in new phenotypic traits.
